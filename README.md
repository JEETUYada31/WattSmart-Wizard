# Wattsmart-Wizard: IoT-Based Energy Monitoring SystemðŸ’¡

Wattsmart-Wizard is an innovative IoT-based solution designed to monitor the energy consumption of household and industrial appliances. This system provides real-time data on usage, identifies inefficiencies, detects leaks, and offers recommendations for energy savings, thereby promoting responsible electricity use and reducing costs.

## Features
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Track the energy consumption of each appliance in real-time.
- **Usage Analysis:** Identify high energy-consuming devices and provide recommendations to reduce consumption.
- **Leakage Detection:** Detect and alert users about potential energy leaks.
- **Performance Insights:** Determine if devices are not performing efficiently in terms of energy usage.
- **User Notifications:** Send real-time alerts and recommendations to users.
- **Sustainability:** Encourage responsible consumption of electricity and reduce overall energy costs.

## Hardware Components
- **ESP32 Microcontroller:** The core processing unit.
- **AC Current Sensor (SCT013030):** Measures current consumption.
- **AC Voltage Sensor (ZMPTEN1B):** Measures voltage levels.
- **LCD Display:** Shows real-time data.
- **Potentiometer:** Adjusts display settings.

## Software Components
- **Blynk App:** User interface for real-time monitoring and control.
- **Python Scripts:** Process and store data in JSON format.
- **Pandas and Matplotlib:** Analyze and visualize power and energy consumption trends.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** For detailed analysis and generating recommendations.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:** Enhance data analysis capabilities for accurate predictions and personalized recommendations (future enhancement).
